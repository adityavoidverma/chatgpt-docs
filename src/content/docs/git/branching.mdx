# ðŸŒ¿ Git Branching

Branches in Git allow you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously without interfering with the main codebase.

## âœ¨ Common Commands

```bash
git branch              # List all branches
git branch <name>       # Create a new branch
git checkout <name>     # Switch to a branch
git checkout -b <name>  # Create and switch in one step
git merge <name>        # Merge a branch into current one
git branch -d <name>    # Delete a branch
