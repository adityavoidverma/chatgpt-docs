# üéØ Introduction to Prompting

Prompting is the way you give input to AI models. The better your prompt, the more accurate and relevant the output will be.

## ü§î What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is any text input you provide to an AI model to guide its response.

Examples:

- **Bad prompt:** "Write essay"
- **Better prompt:** "Write a 200-word essay about the causes of World War I in a formal tone."

## ‚úçÔ∏è Types of Prompts

- Instructional (`Summarize this paragraph`)
- Contextual (`Given the following info...`)
- Conversational (`You are an interviewer...`)

Prompt engineering is **not about tricks**, it's about clarity and intent.
