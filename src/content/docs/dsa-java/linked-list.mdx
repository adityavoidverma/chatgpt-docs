# ðŸ”— Linked Lists in Java

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node. Each node contains two parts:  
1. Data  
2. A reference to the next node

## âœ… Basic Implementation

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int d) { data = d; next = null; }
}
